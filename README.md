# FlameMC
A modloader which makes 0 changes to the game itself.

The ultimate goal for this modloader is to need no maintenance on the loader itself.

No, this has no relation to the server, which apparently exists, and is also called FlameMC.
I had no idea this server existed when I named the mod loader.
I just named it this because if you put fabric in a forge, you get flames.
The two modloaders for Minecraft, are called Fabric and Forge.
See what I did there?
